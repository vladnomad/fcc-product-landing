    <article>
      <p>Alfa Romeo is proud to announce today the all-new 2023 Alfa Romeo Tonale, the metamorphosis – “La Metamorfosi”
        – of the legendary brand highlighted by a new era of luxury, electrification and connectivity while remaining
        true to its race-inspired DNA. As the first C-SUV from Alfa Romeo, North American consumers will experience more
        than 110 years of heritage with the evolution of best-in-class performance from two all-new efficient powertrain
        offerings, which includes a plug-in hybrid with over 30 miles (48 kilometers) of pure electric range and 272
        horsepower. Tonale also features a variety of driver assistance systems, Uconnect 5, an all-new connectivity
        platform with Alfa Connect, sporty and modern Italian styling that remains faithful to the 2019 concept and
        exhilarating driving dynamics from a rapid-response Frequency Damping Suspension (FDS) system.</p>
      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>The definitive design of the Tonale is extraordinarily faithful to the concept car from which it draws its
        origins, courtesy of the remarkable work done at the Design Studio at Centro Stile Alfa Romeo.
        Intended for a young, metropolitan and dynamic customer, the Alfa Romeo Tonale offers a distinctive, sensual and
        forward-looking design. Its compact dimensions – a length of 178.3 inches (4.53 meters), width of 72.4 inches
        (1.84 meters) and height of 63.0 inches (1.6 meters) – encompass the uniqueness of Italian design, and the
        original, contemporary style typical of Alfa Romeo, in a synthesis between a prestigious heritage and looking
        forward to the future.
        The recurrence of stylistic features that have entered the history of world motoring, such as the “GT Line” that
        runs from the rear to the headlights, recalling the forms of the 1960s Giulia GT Junior, and alternating with
        the full and elegant volumes reminiscent of iconic models, such as the 8C Competizione. The front features the
        inimitable “Trilobo” and the distinctive Alfa Romeo “Scudetto” shield, which acts as a central focus.</p>

      </div>
      <p>The Tribolo-inspired “3+3” headlight design with new, full LED evoke the proud look of the SZ Zagato or the
        Proteo concept car. Developed in conjunction with Marelli, the three modules make up a unique frontline for the
        car and simultaneously provide daylight, dynamic turn signals and a “welcome and goodbye” feature (activated
        every time the driver turns the car on or off) to ensure the best lighting conditions. These technologies offer
        greater efficiency, in terms of durability and energy saving with twice the light intensity of conventional
        halogen lamps, lower emissions and improved safety, with less eye strain and better driving comfort.
        The taillights take on the same design cues as the headlights and form a sine curve that fully wraps around the
        rear of the car, making it a truly unique and distinctive light signature.
        The car’s sensuality and dynamism are also clear in the all-encompassing rear window, a tribute to the 8C
        Competizione, and in the design of the alloy wheels that reproduce the Alfa Romeo style canon of a telephone
        dial.</p>

      <p>Inspired by Alfa Romeo's racing history, the interior is strongly focused on the driver, with easy access to
        all controls for a safe, unparalleled driving experience. The same care is reserved for the passengers, who are
        given the ideal space to travel in comfort. This results in an environment designed for and around the
        occupants, characterized by meticulous attention to detail paired with a constant quest for the highest quality.
        The Tonale’s interior arouses real emotions, not to mention the latest technology, ensuring a connected and
        comfortable experience, while maintaining the pleasure of a sporty drive that always remains in the lead.</p>

      <h2>Propulsion</h2>
      <p>The Tonale is the most efficient plug-in hybrid C-SUV in the segment, with an electric range of more than 30
        miles (48 kilometers) and 272-horsepower. The advanced hybrid system uses the 1.3-liter MultiAir turbocharged
        four-cylinder engine (180-horsepower) to provide torque to the front wheels. A high-voltage Belt Starter
        Generator, mounted to the engine, delivers torque to the crankshaft to smooth transitions during changing
        driving conditions, in addition to providing seamless stop-start capability. The Tonale’s efficiency and sporty
        performance is bolstered by a 15.5-kWh lithium-ion battery.
        The all-new Alfa Romeo Tonale also offers a technologically advanced 2.0-liter turbocharged inline
        four-cylinder, a member of Stellantis’ Global Medium Engine family, rated at a best-in-class standard horsepower
        of 256 and 295 lb.-ft. of torque. Equipped with a twin-scroll, low inertia turbocharger, direct fuel injection
        and engine stop-start technology, this engine gives Tonale the brand’s iconic dynamic performance and
        drivability.</p>

      </div>
      <h2>Best-in-class driving dynamics</h2>
      <p>Tonale ensures sports car-like impeccable dynamic behavior, proven by the best weight distribution and the most
        direct steering in its segment (13.6:1 ratio), and the fact it is the only model in its class to be equipped
        with the Integrated Brake System (IBS) and available fixed aluminum shift paddles. The adoption of fixed
        calipers by Brembo, with four pistons and self-ventilated discs at the front and full discs at the rear,
        contributes to the improved braking performance. The Tonale opts for the fully independent MacPherson suspension
        system with Frequency Selective Damping (FSD) shock absorbers.
        The advancement of electric drive modes in Tonale is managed by the exclusive Alfa DNA system that delivers
        optimized maneuvering and performance.
        Through the DNA selector, the driver is also able to select one of the two available pre-set damping curves:
        “Comfort” or “Sport”.
        Systems such as Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control (IACC), Lane Centering (LC) and Traffic Jam Assist (TJA)
        automatically adjust speed and trajectory, keeping the car in the middle of the lane and at a distance from the
        vehicle in front, thus ensuring safety and comfort. The Automatic Emergency Braking, which alerts the driver of
        danger and engages the brakes to avoid or mitigate any collision with a pedestrian or cyclist; Driver Attention
        Assist warns the driver if they become drowsy; Blind Spot Detection detects rear blind spots and signals any
        approaching vehicles to avoid collision; Rear Cross Path detection warns of vehicles approaching on the sides
        when reversing.</p>
      <h2>Production</h2>
      <p>The Alfa Romeo Tonale is built at the Giambattista Vico Stellantis plant in Pomigliano d’Arco, Naples, Italy –
        one of the company's most advanced production sites – on a revamped production line dedicated to the new Alfa
        Romeo model, and a specially created, ultra modern assembly unit. Designed in 1968 by Alfa Romeo and operational
        since 1972, the industrial complex has produced 5 million cars to date and has won numerous international
        awards, including in 2012, World Class Manufacturing (WCM) Silver certification and the Automotive Lean
        Production award for best plant in Europe, followed in 2013 by the WCM Gold Medal and the level of the same
        name. Last year, the plant underwent a major refurbishment to meet the challenges of the future with the
        adoption of the most innovative technologies to build hybrid cars.
        <br><br><br>
        The 2023 Alfa Romeo Tonale will be open for pre-orders in Europe starting from May 2022 and will begin arriving
        in showrooms throughout North America in the first quarter of 2023.
